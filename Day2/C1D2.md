## Chapter 1 - Day 2 - The Flow Blockchain & Cadence

What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars? The pillars are: 

1)Safety and Security
2)Clarity
3)Approachability
4)Developer Experience
5)Intuiting Ownership with Resources

2)In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful: I would say the pillars are useful to achieve Flow blockchain adoption among developers and non developers who are interested in learning programming on a blockchain.
