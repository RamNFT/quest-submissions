1) Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words: blockchain is a technology that provides an online public & decentralized database which anyone can consult or interact with.    
2) Explain what a Smart Contract is: a smart contract is a contract build using a programming language that executes automatically once all their conditions are met.    
3) Explain the difference between a script and a transaction: a transaction is a procees where user A sends money or a NFT to user B trought the blockchain. A script is a function that allows users to explore the blockchain. 

## Chapter 1 - Day 2 - The Flow Blockchain & Cadence

What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars? The pillars are: 

1)Safety and Security
2)Clarity
3)Approachability
4)Developer Experience
5)Intuiting Ownership with Resources

In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful: I would say the pillars are useful to achieve Flow blockchain adoption among developers and non developers who are interested in learning programming on a blockachin.
